1. Issues with the visual expression of documents generating - producing multiple documents visually despite only utilizing a single document. - something related to the system thinking it is in a workspace even on the homepage creates a false search/TOAST
3. On the home page - "open in workspace" does not open the file
4. Closing out one research object sometimes closes out multiple (may be related to 1)
5. not pulling the real generation times or notifications resulting in low information while loading
6. occasional double send of request
7. the chat for workplace would work better if you could see that it was checking documents before answering and if it didnt time out so quickly.
8. for now we remove the find related.
9. research view in the workspace doesnt enable you to view immediately without leaving the space. no option to open in workspace of view right from queue
10. remove sync for refresh where we can manually refresh to see if files appear in the collection yet
11. Creating a workspace and adding documents at the same time results in an error even though the workspace is created and documents assigned on the back end. just requires a refresh.
12. refreshing the page takes you to the home screen not the tab you're in on the tool (no clue if this can be fixed.)
